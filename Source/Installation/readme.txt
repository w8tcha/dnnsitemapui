Description
-----------
Back in the old days, almost every web site had a sitemap where they listed out all the pages. The purpose of the sitemap is to help visitors and search engine spiders to find information on the site.

Now, a lot of modern websites have dropped the sitemap page, instead they place the sitemap in the footer area. 

This Module/Skin Object Creates a SiteMap that looks like such footer SiteMap, but of course it can be placed anywhere on your Website. There a many pre-installed Skins, which changes the look of the SiteMap.

The Module/Skin Object also can Render the SiteMap as a TreeView (With Skin Support & Animations)

  Unique: Sets whether only one tree node can be open at any time, collapsing any previous open nodes.
  Persist: Persists the tree's expand/collapse state in one of two ways: 
          1. "location" - looks within all tree nodes with link anchors that match the document's current URL (location.href), 
                      and if found, expands that node (including its parent nodes). Great for href-based state saving.
